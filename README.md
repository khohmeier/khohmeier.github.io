# About Me
## Education
I am an applied math Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). After graduation, I plan to seek a post-doc position and enter academia.

## Programming Experience and Background
My programming skills derive from both coursework and original research. I have experience with Python, R (package publication: CIS.DGLM), SAS, and MATLAB. Currently, I am learning Julia and would like to improve my MATLAB skills.

# Summary of Major Projects
## Undergraduate Work
I completed my Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics (Honors) and Statistics at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington (UNCW). Through my coursework, I gained knowledge in Python, R, SAS, and MATLAB.

Outside of class, I participated in two National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded projects.

The first project was a joint work between UNCW and the University of South Carolina at Beaufort (USCB). As part of this team-based research project, I performed spatial-temporal analysis on obesity data in Jasper County, SC, and proposed both multiple linear regression and logistic regression models as a tool to study the obesity epidemic in the low country of South Carolina. I gave three presentations on this research: The Center for the Support of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships (CSURF) Poster Showcase, UNCW; Student Research and Scholarship Day, USCB; and the International Conference on Advances in Interdisciplinary Statistics and Combinatorics (AISC), UNCG.

The second project was an interdisiplinary team-based research project that studied and modeled the impact of particular genotypes on stress regulartion factors in hybrid and inbred maize plants. As part of the project, we published an R package called CIS.DGLM (“Covariates, Interaction Terms, and Selection, Double Generalized Linear Models”), both as an improvement on the R package dglm and providing new functionality for researchers in this field. I played a lead role in preparing and submitting the package for publication and learned the process for publishing a package on CRAN. I also made significant contributions to the team's Read the Docs page, which contains further details on this research: https://stapleton-lab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. All codes for this project can be found at the following GitHub respository: https://github.com/MRCopeland74/stapleton_lab.

## Graduate Work
Currently I am working in optimal transport with my advisors Dr. Caroline Moosmueller and Dr. Nicolas Fraiman.
